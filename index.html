						In 2019, the institute has signed two MoUs with NJIT, USA, for summer research and Ph.D programs at NJIT, and one MoU with IIT-Kanpur for promoting entrepreneurship and startups by sharing resources such as research facilities and mentors. The MoU for doctorate programs at NJIT reduces the expense of international students and brings them a lot of convenience where they can stay in their home country during the first year of their PhD studies. The MoU to hold Summer Research Programs at NJIT brings NIST students the best of right cultural environment, academic, and research exposure. It provides students with the opportunity for a global experience to enhance skills basis reciprocity and frequent interactions with NJIT mentors and students.
						<br><br>
						NIST has also signed an MoU with IIT-Kanpur to share their network resources towards building a stronger and vibrant incubation ecosystem. Both the premier institutes will explore possibilities on a case to case basis for co-incubation of startups by sharing mentors and extending specialized labs and product development infrastructure. NIST, in association with IIT, Kharagpur, is also part of the MHRD Virtual Laboratory project. The institute has signed MoUs for research collaboration in the field of nano sciences, communications, semiconductor technology with the National Taiwan University and University of Electro Communications, Japan. Also, every year a record number of NIST students are selected for master's programs and research programs in the international university, National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Taiwan.
